description: "Start or resume a UNITARES session in Codex and refresh local continuity state"
---

Start by checking for a local continuity cache in `.unitares/session.json` inside the current workspace.

Use the shared helper in this plugin repo:

- `scripts/session_cache.py get session`

If the file exists:

- read it
- prefer `continuity_token` when present
- otherwise use `client_session_id`

Then call `onboard()` against UNITARES:

- include `continuity_token` when available
- otherwise include `client_session_id` when available
- include `model_type` when the current runtime is clear from context
- do not invent a display name unless the user asked for one

After a successful response:

- create or update `.unitares/session.json` using `scripts/session_cache.py set session --merge --stamp`
- keep it compact and machine-readable JSON
- include:
  - `server_url` when known
  - `uuid`
  - `agent_id`
  - `display_name`
  - `client_session_id`
  - `continuity_token`
  - `session_resolution_source`
  - `continuity_token_supported`
  - `updated_at`

When reporting back:

- say whether the identity was created or resumed
- show the resolved display name or agent id
- note whether continuity is strong or weak
- mention the next useful command:
  - `/checkin` after meaningful work
  - `/diagnose` if continuity still looks wrong

Do not dump raw JSON unless the user asks for it.
Prefer a short interpreted summary.
