description: "Manual UNITARES governance check-in after meaningful work"
---

Before calling tools, check for `.unitares/session.json` in the current workspace.

Use the shared helper in this plugin repo:

- `scripts/session_cache.py get session`

If it exists:

- prefer `continuity_token`
- otherwise use `client_session_id`

If no local continuity state exists and the current identity is unclear, use `/governance-start` first.

Call `process_agent_update` for the current agent after a meaningful unit of work.

Inputs:

- `response_text`: concise summary of what was actually accomplished
- `complexity`: estimate `0.0-1.0`
- `confidence`: honest estimate `0.0-1.0`
- include `continuity_token` when available, otherwise `client_session_id`
- use `response_mode="mirror"` by default for Codex

Guidelines:

- Do not check in after every trivial edit.
- Prefer one check-in per meaningful milestone, completed step, or decision point.
- If recent local edit context exists, use it to improve the summary, but do not report raw file churn as if it were real progress.
- If deterministic results already happened in the workflow, mention them concretely instead of speaking in generalities.

After the call:

- report the verdict
- report margin or edge warnings when present
- report any guidance briefly
- report the mirror question when present
- if verdict is `pause` or `reject`, recommend `request_dialectic_review`
- if verdict is `guide`, summarize the guidance and adjust behavior

On a successful check-in, clear the local milestone accumulator and stamp the
session's `last_checkin_ts` so the post-edit auto-checkin hook sees this call
and does not re-fire on the next edit. Use the shared helper:

- `scripts/session_cache.py reset-milestone --workspace <pwd>`
- `scripts/session_cache.py set session --workspace <pwd> --merge --stamp --json '{"last_checkin_ts": <now_epoch>}'`
