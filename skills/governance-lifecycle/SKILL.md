  Use when an agent is interacting with UNITARES governance for the first time, needs to
  onboard, check in, or recover from a pause/reject verdict. Covers the full agent lifecycle
  from session start through check-ins to recovery.

# Agent Lifecycle

## Starting a Session

Call `onboard()` to register or reconnect:

```
onboard(name, model_type)
```

Returns:
- **UUID**: Your persistent identity across sessions
- **client_session_id**: Echo this back in subsequent calls for session continuity

### Naming Convention

`{purpose}_{client}_{date}` — for example: `refactor_hikewa_claude_ai_20260223`

## Check-ins

Call `process_agent_update()` after meaningful work:

```
process_agent_update(
  response_text: "Brief summary of what you did",
  complexity: 0.0-1.0,   # Task difficulty estimate
  confidence: 0.0-1.0    # How confident you are (be honest)
)
```

### When to Check In

- After completing a meaningful unit of work
- Before and after high-complexity tasks
- When you feel uncertain or notice drift
- **Not** after every single tool call — use judgment

### What You Get Back

A verdict plus current EISV metrics. Read the verdict and act on it.

## Reading Verdicts

| Verdict | What to Do |
|---------|-----------|
| **proceed** | Continue normally |
| **guide** + guidance text | Read the guidance, adjust your approach, keep going |
| **pause** | Stop your current task. Reflect on what is flagged. Consider requesting a dialectic review |
| **reject** | Significant concern. Requires dialectic review or human intervention |
| **margin: tight** | You are near a basin edge. Be more careful with next steps |

A `guide` verdict is an early warning. Ignoring it makes `pause` more likely.

## Identity

- Your identity persists across sessions via UUID
- Session binding happens via MCP session headers (automatic) or `client_session_id` (explicit)
- One UUID per agent, deterministic across tool calls within a session
- Pass `client_session_id` from `onboard()` in subsequent calls for continuity

## Recovery

When you are paused, stuck, or need intervention:

| Situation | Tool | Notes |
|-----------|------|-------|
| Stuck or paused, want automatic recovery | `self_recovery()` | Attempts to restore healthy state |
| Disagree with verdict, want structured review | `request_dialectic_review()` | Starts thesis/antithesis/synthesis process |
| Manual override needed | `operator_resume_agent()` | Requires human/operator action |

Recovery is not a shortcut — `self_recovery()` examines your EISV state and determines if resumption is safe. If your metrics are genuinely degraded, it will not force a resume.

## MCP Tools Reference

### Essential (use in every session)

- `onboard()` — Register or reconnect identity
- `process_agent_update()` — Check in with work summary, complexity, confidence
- `get_governance_metrics()` — Read your current EISV state
- `search_knowledge_graph()` — Find existing knowledge before creating new entries
- `leave_note()` — Quick contribution to the knowledge graph

### Common (use when needed)

- `knowledge()` — Full knowledge graph CRUD (store, update, details, cleanup)
- `agent()` — Agent lifecycle (list, archive, get details)
- `calibration()` — Check or update calibration data
- `request_dialectic_review()` — Start a dialectic session
- `health_check()` — System component status
- `export()` — Export session history

### Specialized

- `call_model()` — Delegate to a secondary LLM for analysis
- `detect_stuck_agents()` — Find unresponsive agents
- `self_recovery()` — Resume from stuck or paused state
- `submit_thesis()` / `submit_antithesis()` / `submit_synthesis()` — Dialectic participation
